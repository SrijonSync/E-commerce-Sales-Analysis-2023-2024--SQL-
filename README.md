SELECT MIN(OrderCreatedOn) AS start_date, MAX(OrderCreatedOn) AS end_date
FROM othoba_sales;
```

### Average Order Value (AOV) per Year
```sql
SELECT year, ROUND(SUM(TotalSellingPrice)/COUNT(DISTINCT SubOrderId), 2) AS AVG_ODR_VALUE
FROM othoba_sales GROUP BY year;
```

### Total Revenue per Year
```sql
SELECT SUM(totalsellingprice), Year AS Total_revenue
FROM othoba_sales
WHERE FinalOrderStatus = 'Sales' GROUP BY Year;
```

### Best-Performing Product Categories (2023 & 2024)
```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, SUM(totalsellingprice) AS TOTAL_REV
FROM othoba_sales
WHERE B2C_B2B = 'Others' AND Year= '2023' AND FinalOrderStatus='Sales'
GROUP BY CATEGORY
ORDER BY TOTAL_REV DESC;
```
```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, SUM(totalsellingprice) AS TOTAL_REV

ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### Repeat Customer Rate
